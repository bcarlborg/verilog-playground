# Verilog Playground

This is a repository for me to store the various hardware components I design in verilog hardware description language.
"Circuits described in Verilog can be used to define the logical design of an integrated circuit."

## What is Verilog

Verilog is a [hardware description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language). It allows developers to write code that can be _compiled_ into a layout plan for a circuit. This allows developers to describe digital circuits using a programming language.

Circuits described in verilog can be realized in a number of different physical forms. Circuits defined in verilog can be used to define the logical design of an integrated circuit can be used to configure an FPGA. The verilog descriptions of circuits can also be simulated on a computer to allow for more rapid iteration before working with actual hardware.

## What are the Verilog Files in this Repository?

The verilog circuits in this repository describe digital circuits from a handful of different resources I am using to learn about digital electronic design
