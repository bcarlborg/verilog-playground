# TODOs

A short list of TODOs that I am keeping for this project. Generally used as a dumping ground to track whatever thing I want to make next.

- [ ] change the sel and output pins on the MUX and DMUX lines to use buses rather than listed enumerated pins
- [ ] move "test complete" to be "starting test" above the group of tests
- [ ] review approach to mux test bench.
  - [ ] Look for places where names can be made more clear
  - [ ] Look for places where we can consolidate verification code into one mux verification function and one one dmux verification
