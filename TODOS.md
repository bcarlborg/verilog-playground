# TODOs

A short list of TODOs that I am keeping for this project. Generally used as a dumping ground to track whatever thing I want to make next.

- Think a little bit more about how to track the dependencies between files with make
  - Make the TB files one to one with the test files?
  - Think a little bit more about how the dependencies between these files can be tracked and
    accounted for in the make file.
  - Question: Can I use a makefile in each directory that describes the other files that
    are dependencies of the current files?
