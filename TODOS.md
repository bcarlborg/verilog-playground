# TODOs

A short list of TODOs that I am keeping for this project. Generally used as a dumping ground to track whatever thing I want to make next.

- [ ] change the sel and output pins on the MUX and DMUX lines to use buses rather than listed enumerated pins
- [ ] name arguments passed to verification tests and remove comments to the right of the verification calls
- [ ] review approach to mux test bench.
  - [ ] Look for places where names can be made more clear
  - [ ] Look for places where we can consolidate verification code into one mux verification function and one one dmux verification
